# Commerce Search API Integration

Included in the box:

- Automatically created Search API db server, if none is found.
- Auto-generated search index that includes all product display node types* and
related product data.
- Auto-generated facets for all node type categories and product attributes.
- Optional integration with Search API Ranges.
- Search API Filter class for product display node types*
(allowing for an index composed only of product displays).
- Facet API Filter class for removing facet items that do not change search
results.
- Facet API Filter class for hiding certain facets on the initial search
(so that product attribute facets are only shown after the initial search.

## Note

Commerce 1.4 or higher is required, since it added the amount_decimal property,
allowing prices to be indexed properly.
